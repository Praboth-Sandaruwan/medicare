# Medicare

Cross-platform Flutter application for healthcare assistance, featuring authentication, patient management, reminders and local notifications, QR code generation/scanning, emergency contacts, profile management, and mapping/location utilities.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter SDK (Dart) >= 3.5
- Firebase (Core, Auth, Cloud Firestore)
- Local notifications with timezone support
- Geolocation and maps
- Shared preferences and SQLite for local storage
- Custom UI widgets

## Key Features

- User authentication (sign up, log in, profile)
- Patient records: add, edit, view
- QR codes: generate for patient details and scan
- Reminders: schedule and manage with local notifications
- Emergency SOS and contacts
- Map and location utilities
- Chat and history screens

## Entry Points and Routing

- App entry: [`void main()`](lib/main.dart:13) initializes Firebase and notifications, then launches [`class MyApp`](lib/main.dart:25).
- Route generation: [`AppRoutes.generateRoute()`](lib/routes/app_routes.dart:11) with paths for splash, welcome, and the main app screen.
- Firebase configuration holder: [`class DefaultFirebaseOptions`](lib/firebase_options.dart:17) for platform-specific options.

## Dependencies

Core dependencies are declared in [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml). Highlights include:
- firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore
- flutter_local_notifications, timezone
- geolocator, google_maps_flutter, flutter_map, latlong2
- shared_preferences, sqflite, path_provider
- qr_flutter, barcode_scan2, image_picker, url_launcher
- font_awesome_flutter, google_fonts, animations, carousel_slider

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK and Dart installed (Dart SDK constraint: >= 3.5.2)
- A configured Firebase project with platform apps:
  - Android: [android/app/google-services.json](android/app/google-services.json)
  - iOS/macOS: ensure proper bundle identifiers and plist configuration in [ios/Runner/Info.plist](ios/Runner/Info.plist) and [macos/Runner/Info.plist](macos/Runner/Info.plist)
  - Web/Windows: configuration via [lib/firebase_options.dart](lib/firebase_options.dart)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running Flutter package get.
3. Verify Firebase setup:
   - Confirm [`class DefaultFirebaseOptions`](lib/firebase_options.dart:17) aligns with your Firebase project.
   - Confirm platform files exist (e.g., [android/app/google-services.json](android/app/google-services.json)).
4. Configure required permissions (see Permissions).

## Running the App

- Connect a device or start an emulator.
- From the project root, run Flutter’s standard run command for your target platform.
- The app launches to [lib/features/medical/Screens/login_screen.dart](lib/features/medical/Screens/login_screen.dart) via [`class MyApp`](lib/main.dart:25).

## Permissions

The app uses several permissions depending on features:
- Location (maps and geolocator)
- Camera (QR scanning and image picker)
- Notifications (local alerts and reminders)
- Storage (if exporting data or caching assets)

On Android, declare permissions in manifest and request at runtime via permission_handler. On iOS, add usage descriptions to Info.plist.

## Build and Release

- Android: build APK/AAB via standard Flutter build commands and configure signing in android/app.
- iOS/macOS: use Xcode for signing and distribution after Flutter build for iOS/macOS.
- Web/Windows/Linux: standard Flutter build commands produce artifacts in build/ directories.

## Testing

- Widget tests are under [test](test). Run Flutter’s test command at project root.

## Development Notes

- Routing is centralized in [`AppRoutes.generateRoute()`](lib/routes/app_routes.dart:11).
- App entry and initialization live in [`void main()`](lib/main.dart:13) and [`class MyApp`](lib/main.dart:25).
- Notifications are initialized at app start; ensure device timezones are correctly set.
- Shared preferences store lightweight user settings and state in [lib/utils/shared_preferences_helper.dart](lib/utils/shared_preferences_helper.dart).
- Local data helpers and map utilities live in [lib/features/map_feature](lib/features/map_feature).

## Contribution Guidelines

- Open issues for bugs and feature proposals.
- Follow effective Dart/Flutter lints configured via [analysis_options.yaml](analysis_options.yaml).
- Keep secrets out of the repository; do not commit private keys or tokens.
